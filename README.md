Research Design Framework
This study adopts a three-phase "Generation-Validation-Optimization" research framework, integrating three deep learning tools - ESM3 for sequence generation, AlphaFold3 for structural validation, and DeepGO for functional prediction - to establish a comprehensive workflow for EF-hand protein design. The research design follows the DBTL (Design-Build-Test-Learn) cycle concept, with iterative optimization conducted through multiple rounds.
